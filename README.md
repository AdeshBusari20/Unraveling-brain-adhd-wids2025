# Unraveling Brain ADHD - WiDS 2025

This repository contains my first Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning project for the *“Unraveling the Mysteries of the Female Brain”* challenge, completed as part of the *WiDS Datathon 2025*. The project focuses on uncovering differences in ADHD presentation between males and females using demographic, behavioral, and MRI-based data.

---

## 📌 Overview

I worked with a rich dataset containing demographic, behavioral, and MRI-based attributes to identify patterns, build predictive models, and interpret meaningful insights.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes participant demographics, parenting assessments, behavioral scores, MRI scan information, and ADHD outcome labels.

*Example attributes:*

- *Demographics:* Age, sex, ethnicity, race, study site  
- *Parental Assessments:* Positive parenting score, corporal punishment score, involvement score  
- *Behavioral Scales:* Conduct problems, hyperactivity, emotional problems, prosocial scale  
- *MRI Info:* Laterality index, scan location, age at scan  
- *Target:* ADHD outcome

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

- *Data Manipulation & Analysis:* NumPy, Pandas  
- *Visualization:* Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- *Machine Learning:* Scikit-learn (SVC, Ridge Regression, scaling, model evaluation)  
- *Statistical Analysis:* SciPy  
- *System & File Handling:* OS

## 📈 Project Workflow

1. *Data Understanding:* Exploring attribute descriptions and value distributions  
2. *Data Cleaning:* Handling missing values, correcting data types, outlier checks  
3. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):* Visualizing feature distributions, correlations, and gender-specific patterns  
4. *Feature Engineering:* Creating new attributes to improve model performance  
5. *Model Building:* Training models like Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and Ridge Regression  
6. *Evaluation:* Using accuracy, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices to assess performance

## 🎯 Key Insights

- Certain behavioral scores differ significantly between males and females with ADHD  
- Parenting style scores (e.g., positive parenting, corporal punishment) are linked to ADHD outcomes  
- MRI-based laterality measures may have predictive potential for ADHD diagnosis

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned how to:

- Approach a dataset methodically  
- Combine statistics and visualizations to uncover insights  
- Apply ML models to a real-world healthcare dataset  
- Explain technical findings in simple language  

---


## 🚀 Future Work

- Experiment with advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost) to improve performance  
- Use feature selection to reduce noise and enhance accuracy  
- Perform deeper analysis on MRI metrics
